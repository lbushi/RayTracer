COMPILATION

In order to compile the program, you must go the A0 directory of the folder and from there run the following commands:
premake4 gmake
make
Afterwards, in order to run the program simply do:
./A0
In other words, the original workflow of the build has not changed.


MANUAL

There is only onde detail that is perhaps worth mentioning here and that is the range of the rotation slider of the triangle.
It is set to have values in the interval [0, 2*PI] so it allows for exactly one full rotation. Other than this, there are no other
details or assumptions worthy of mentionong here.
